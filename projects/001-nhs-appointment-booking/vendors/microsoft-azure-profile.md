## Overview

Microsoft Azure is the second-largest global cloud platform, operated by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT). Azure has significant NHS presence through NHS Trust enterprise agreements (Microsoft 365, Azure Active Directory) and is the provider of Azure Health Data Services — the only managed FHIR R4 service listed on the UK Government G-Cloud 14 Digital Marketplace. Azure UK South (London) and UK West (Cardiff) data centres provide UK data residency. Azure is positioned as a secondary/alternative cloud option for the NHS Appointment Booking Service, particularly relevant for hospital PAS integration where many Trusts run on Azure infrastructure.

## Products & Services

**Compute**: AKS (Kubernetes — automatic mode available 2024), Virtual Machines, Azure Container Apps, Azure Functions (serverless)

**Database**: Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL, Azure Cache for Redis

**Health-specific**: Azure Health Data Services (FHIR R4 service, DICOM service, MedTech service) — G-Cloud 14 listed

**Messaging**: Azure Service Bus (AMQP, message sessions, dead-letter), Azure Event Grid, Azure Event Hubs

**Networking**: Azure Front Door (CDN + WAF), Azure Load Balancer, Azure Application Gateway + WAF

**Security**: Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Azure Key Vault (HSM-backed), Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel

**Developer Tools**: Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions (Microsoft-owned), Azure Pipelines

## Pricing Model

Reservation-based (1-year and 3-year) with significant discounts over pay-as-you-go. Enterprise Agreements provide committed spend discounts. AKS cluster management is free (pay only for underlying VMs). Azure Health Data Services pricing not publicly listed — "contact sales" for quotes based on provisioned throughput (RU/s) and structured storage (GB).

## UK Government Presence

- G-Cloud listed: yes (G-Cloud 14, multiple lots including Lot 2 for Azure Health Data Services)
- Azure Health Data Services G-Cloud 14 service ID: 926971059674068
- DOS listed: yes
- UK data centres: yes — UK South (London), UK West (Cardiff/South Wales)
- NHS Trust adoption: very high — majority of NHS Trusts have Microsoft 365/Azure enterprise agreements
- ISO 27001 / SOC 2 Type II / PCI DSS Level 1: All certified
- NHS DSPT: Compliant — less explicitly publicised than AWS DSPT "Standards Exceeded" status

## Strengths

- Azure Health Data Services (FHIR R4) available directly on G-Cloud 14 — no custom procurement
- AKS automatic mode simplifies Kubernetes management — lower operational complexity than EKS
- Extremely high NHS Trust adoption — hospital PAS integration Phase 2 may benefit from Azure alignment
- Microsoft Entra ID familiar to NHS IT teams (most Trusts use Azure AD for staff identity)
- Azure Monitor + Application Insights: managed observability integrated with AKS
- Azure Service Bus Premium: enterprise-grade messaging with AMQP, message sessions, guaranteed ordering
- Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions (also Microsoft): tight CI/CD integration

## Weaknesses

- FHIR service pricing opaque — cannot model TCO without direct Microsoft engagement
- NHS DSPT certification evidence less prominent than AWS (not published as "Standards Exceeded" equivalent)
- Azure Service Bus Premium significantly costlier than AWS SQS at appointment booking volumes
- Creates dual-cloud architecture complexity if primary cloud is AWS (increases DevOps overhead)
- Azure FHIR service not fully pre-configured for NHS-specific FHIR profiles and GP Connect — custom development still required
