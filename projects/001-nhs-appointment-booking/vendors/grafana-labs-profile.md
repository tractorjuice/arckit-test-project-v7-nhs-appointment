## Overview

Grafana Labs is a US-headquartered observability company (founded 2014, San Francisco) that stewards the Grafana open-source project (63,000+ GitHub stars) and operates the Grafana Cloud managed observability platform. The Grafana OSS ecosystem includes Grafana (dashboards), Prometheus (metrics — CNCF Graduated), Loki (log aggregation), and Tempo (distributed tracing). This stack has become the de facto standard for Kubernetes-native observability and is widely deployed in NHS engineering teams. Grafana Labs raised Series D funding ($240M, valuation $6B) in 2022.

## Products & Services

**Open Source (free, self-hosted)**:
- Grafana OSS: Dashboard and visualisation platform (Apache 2.0)
- Prometheus: Metrics collection and alerting (Apache 2.0, CNCF Graduated)
- Loki: Log aggregation — "Prometheus for logs" (AGPL-3.0 — legal review advised for NHS commercial)
- Tempo: Distributed tracing backend (Apache 2.0)
- AlertManager: SLO-based alerting with routing and grouping (Apache 2.0)

**Grafana Cloud (managed SaaS)**:
- Free tier: 10,000 metrics series, 50GB logs, 50GB traces/month
- Pro tier: $19/month base + usage-based billing ($6.50/1,000 metrics series, $0.40/GB logs)
- Enterprise: $25,000/year minimum commitment, volume discounts

**Grafana Enterprise (commercial licence for self-hosted)**:
- Adds enterprise data sources, LDAP/SAML SSO, analytics, SLA support
- Pricing on request

## Pricing Model

Primarily open-source (free to self-host). Grafana Cloud charges per telemetry data (metrics series, GB logs, GB traces). Enterprise support contracts available separately. Significant cost advantage over proprietary SaaS at NHS scale (50,000 concurrent users, 200+ pods).

Estimated NHS appointment booking service observability cost (Grafana OSS self-hosted):
- Year 1: £78,000 (includes setup), Year 2: £66,000, Year 3: £82,000
- 3-Year TCO: £226,000 vs Datadog ~£454,500

## UK Government Presence

- G-Cloud listed: yes (Grafana Cloud)
- DOS listed: unknown
- UK data centres: Grafana Cloud AWS us-east-1 / eu-west-1 (self-hosted on AWS eu-west-2 avoids this)
- NHS clients: NHS engineering teams widely use Grafana OSS — not exclusively Grafana Labs commercial

## Strengths

- Apache 2.0 licence for Grafana, Prometheus, Tempo — zero licensing cost for core observability
- Prometheus is Kubernetes-native metrics standard — perfect fit for EKS architecture (NFR-M-001)
- kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart: production-ready deployment in hours
- Full control over PII/NHS Number redaction in logs — critical for patient data compliance
- AlertManager supports SLO-based alerting with runbook links — matches NFR-M-001 requirements
- CNCF Graduated projects (Prometheus) carry the highest open-source maturity rating
- Grafana dashboards familiar to NHS engineering community

## Weaknesses

- Loki is AGPL-3.0 — requires legal review before NHS commercial deployment; may need Grafana Enterprise licence
- Operational overhead: 5-6 Helm chart upgrade cycles per year across Grafana/Prometheus/Loki/Tempo/AlertManager
- No out-of-box 24/7 support SLA without Grafana Enterprise or Cloud subscription
- Self-hosted Loki requires object storage configuration (S3) for long-term retention — operational complexity
- Grafana Cloud data residency: default US/EU — self-hosting required for UK patient-adjacent telemetry
