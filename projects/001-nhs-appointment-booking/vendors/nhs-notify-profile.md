## Overview

NHS Notify is the NHS patient communications platform, operated by NHS England Digital, that enables NHS services to send NHS App push notifications, SMS, email, and letters to patients. NHS Notify uses communication suppliers including GOV.UK Notify infrastructure and additional NHS-specific capabilities (NHS App messaging). In February 2025, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care issued NHS Notify Service Directions 2025 to NHS England, effectively mandating use of NHS Notify for NHS patient communications. NHS Notify is built on GOV.UK Notify (operated by GDS) and extends it with NHS-specific capabilities.

## UK Government Presence

- GOV.UK platform: yes — NHS England Digital operated
- No procurement required: yes — NHS-funded platform
- UK data centres: yes — all data remains within NHS/UK infrastructure
- GDPR compliant: yes

## Strengths

- NHS Notify Service Directions 2025: Secretary of State effectively mandates use for NHS patient communications
- No procurement overhead — no OJEU, no framework, no contract negotiation
- NHS App push notifications at zero marginal cost — reduces SMS volume significantly
- Welsh language template support meets FR-010 (Welsh Language Standards compliance)
- Pre-built delivery status webhooks — INT-004 requirement met without custom development
- Deep link support enables one-click appointment management from reminders (FR-005)
- All data within NHS/UK infrastructure — GDPR and UK data residency maintained
- Integration takes 4 person-weeks estimate — very low barrier to entry

## Weaknesses

- SMS volume costs significant at national scale: £380,000 estimated in Year 3 for 100M+ appointment programme
- Letter delivery adds per-unit cost for digitally excluded citizens (BR-004)
- No publicly published uptime SLA for NHS Notify (assumed 99.9% by policy — confirmation required)
- Dependency on NHS England — service evolution and outage management outside project control
- Limited to NHS/public sector use — cannot extend to private healthcare bookings
- NHS App push requires citizen to have NHS App installed — not all patients will have it
