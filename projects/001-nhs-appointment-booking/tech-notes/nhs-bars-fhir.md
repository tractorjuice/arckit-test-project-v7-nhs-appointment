## Summary

The NHS Booking and Referral Standard (BaRS) is the NHS England Digital strategic API standard for booking and referral information exchange between healthcare IT systems. BaRS replaces the earlier NHS Booking Standard and delivers enhanced capability using HL7 FHIR R4. The BaRS API is a centrally hosted and maintained proxy that brokers endpoint discovery and routes requests between senders and receivers. BaRS is published at digital.nhs.uk and available as a RESTful HL7 FHIR API. Post-implementation review dates are March 2024 (initial) and March 2025 (intermediate). The NHS Booking FHIR API (nhs-booking-fhir) and Booking and Referral FHIR API (booking-and-referral-fhir) are both catalogued in the NHS API catalogue.

## Key Findings

- **Strategic Direction**: BaRS is the NHS England mandated standard for appointment booking interoperability. All new NHS appointment booking integrations should use BaRS rather than proprietary point-to-point APIs.
- **Architecture**: BaRS is a proxy — all requests route through the centrally hosted BaRS API, which brokers the endpoint for a given service and delivers the request to the receiver (GP system, hospital PAS). Developers do not need to discover or manage individual provider endpoints.
- **FHIR Version**: HL7 FHIR R4 (v4.0.1). BaRS Core provides core functionality; BaRS Applications provide use-case-specific profiles (e.g., appointment booking for GP, 999 dispatch, outpatients).
- **GP Connect Relationship**: BaRS builds on and extends GP Connect for the appointment booking use case. GP Connect Appointment APIs (Slots, Appointments) are consumed via GP Connect but the BaRS standard governs the booking workflow.
- **NHS Spine Authentication**: BaRS requires NHS Spine ASID (Accredited System Identifier) registration and TLS-MA (Mutual Authentication) certificates. ASID registration takes 4-6 weeks minimum — start early.
- **GitHub Repository**: github.com/NHSDigital/booking-and-referral-fhir-api — contains API specification, Postman collections, and test suite.
- **Hospital PAS Integration (Phase 2)**: BaRS Applications for outpatient booking are in development. Hospital PAS vendors must implement BaRS to be compatible. Not all PAS vendors have BaRS support in 2025 — trust-by-trust assessment required for Phase 2.
- **Cost**: BaRS API usage is free (NHS Digital funded). Custom integration adapters that implement BaRS require development effort (estimated 24 person-months for GP Connect + PDS adapters).
- **FHIR Profiles**: BaRS uses UK Core FHIR profiles. HAPI FHIR server with UK Core profile validation is the recommended FHIR infrastructure for BaRS implementation.
- **Security**: NHS Spine Security Proxy (SSP) handles ASID-to-endpoint routing. TLS-MA ensures mutual authentication between sender and receiver via NHS Spine certificates.

## Relevance to Projects

- **ARC-001 NHS Appointment Booking Service**: Mandatory integration standard for GP appointment booking (INT-001) and Hospital PAS integration (INT-002 Phase 2). All FHIR integration adapters must conform to BaRS. ASID registration must begin immediately — 4-6 week lead time.
