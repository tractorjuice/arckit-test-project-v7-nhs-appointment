## Timeline Estimates

This plan is based on a **Medium** complexity project.
- **Discovery**: 6 weeks
- **Alpha**: 10 weeks
- **Beta**: 18 weeks
- **Total Duration**: 34 weeks to Go-Live, 46 weeks total.

This timeline is an estimate and should be reviewed at the end of each phase.

## Risks and Assumptions

**Key Risks**:
- Hospital trust integration delays may impact the timeline for secondary care features.
- Low citizen adoption could undermine the project's value proposition.
- Performance under national-scale load is a significant technical risk.

**Key Assumptions**:
- NHS login and GP Connect APIs will be stable and available.
- Hospital trusts will adopt standardized integration APIs.
- The project will be funded sufficiently based on the business case.
