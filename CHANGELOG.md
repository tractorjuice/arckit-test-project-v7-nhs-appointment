  - Automatic conversion maintains command functionality and arguments
  - Complete parity: Claude, Codex, and Gemini now have identical command sets
  - Credit: @umag (PR #5)

- **Digital Marketplace Command Split**: Split monolithic command into three focused commands
  - **`/arckit.dos`** - Digital Outcomes and Specialists (custom development)
    - ~400 lines (focused, clean - down from 754 lines)
    - Covers 95% of arc-kit use cases
    - Essential vs desirable skills extraction
    - Evaluation framework (40% Technical, 30% Team, 20% Quality, 10% Value)
    - Technology-agnostic success criteria
    - No branching logic (DOS only)
  - **`/arckit.gcloud-search`** - G-Cloud with Live Marketplace Search
    - ~500 lines with WebSearch integration
    - **Live Digital Marketplace search** using WebSearch
    - Searches: `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud [keywords]`
    - Finds actual services with suppliers, prices, features, links
    - Service comparison table (top 3-5 services)
    - Recommendations based on requirements match
    - Covers 5% of use cases (cloud services only)
  - **`/arckit.gcloud-clarify`** - G-Cloud Service Validation (NEW!)
    - **Bridge between search and evaluation** - validates services before supplier engagement
    - Systematic gap analysis (MUST/SHOULD requirements vs service descriptions)
    - Detects three gap types: ✅ Confirmed, ⚠️ Ambiguous, ❌ Not mentioned
    - Generates prioritized questions (🔴 Critical / 🟠 High / 🔵 Medium / 🟢 Low)
    - Risk assessment matrix for each service
    - Email templates for supplier engagement
    - Evidence requirements specification
    - Completes the G-Cloud workflow: Search → Clarify → Evaluate

### Changed

- **Command Count**: Now 25 commands per AI assistant (22 original + 3 new G-Cloud commands)
- **README**: Updated to reflect new DOS, G-Cloud search, and G-Cloud clarify commands
- **Complete G-Cloud Workflow**: Requirements → Search → Clarify → Engage → Evaluate → Award

### Deprecated

- **`/arckit.digital-marketplace`**: Now deprecated (replaced by dos, gcloud-search, gcloud-clarify)
  - Still functional with clear deprecation notice
  - Migration guide provided directing users to appropriate commands
  - Will be removed in future version

### Benefits

- **Clearer Purpose**: No framework confusion (DOS vs G-Cloud)
- **More Powerful**: G-Cloud search finds actual services, not just requirements
- **Complete Validation**: Gap analysis identifies missing/ambiguous requirements before supplier engagement
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies blockers BEFORE contacting suppliers
- **Better UX**: Users know which command to use at each workflow stage
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused templates (400-500 lines vs 754)
- **Time Savings**:
  - G-Cloud search: 30+ minutes of manual marketplace searching automated
  - G-Cloud clarify: 30-60 minutes of manual gap analysis automated
  - Total: 1-2 hours saved per procurement
- **Structured Process**: End-to-end G-Cloud workflow from discovery to contract award
