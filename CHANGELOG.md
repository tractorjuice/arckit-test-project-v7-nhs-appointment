    - ~500 lines with WebSearch integration
    - **Live Digital Marketplace search** using WebSearch
    - Searches: `site:digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk g-cloud [keywords]`
    - Finds actual services with suppliers, prices, features, links
    - Service comparison table (top 3-5 services)
    - Recommendations based on requirements match
    - Covers 5% of use cases (cloud services only)
  - **`/arckit.gcloud-clarify`** - G-Cloud Service Validation (NEW!)
    - **Bridge between search and evaluation** - validates services before supplier engagement
    - Systematic gap analysis (MUST/SHOULD requirements vs service descriptions)
    - Detects three gap types: ‚úÖ Confirmed, ‚ö†Ô∏è Ambiguous, ‚ùå Not mentioned
    - Generates prioritized questions (üî¥ Critical / üü† High / üîµ Medium / üü¢ Low)
