# Requirements Guide

A comprehensive guide to writing effective business and technical requirements using ArcKit.

---

## What Are Requirements?

Requirements define **what** a system must do (functional) and **how well** it must do it (non-functional). They serve as the contract between business stakeholders, architects, and implementation teams.

### Why Requirements Matter

Without good requirements:
- ❌ Scope creep and missed expectations
- ❌ Vendor proposals that don't address real needs
- ❌ Design reviews with no objective criteria
- ❌ Failed implementations that don't meet business needs
- ❌ No traceability for compliance audits

With good requirements:
- ✅ Clear scope and acceptance criteria
- ✅ Objective vendor evaluation
- ✅ Design reviews with measurable standards
- ✅ Implementations that solve actual problems
- ✅ Complete traceability for audits

## Creating Requirements with ArcKit

### Step 1: Ensure Principles Exist

```bash
# Check if principles are defined
ls .arckit/memory/architecture-principles.md

# If not, create them first
/arckit.principles Create principles for [your organization]
```

### Step 2: Analyze Stakeholders (CRITICAL - Do This BEFORE Requirements!)

```bash
/arckit.stakeholders Analyze stakeholders for [your project]
```

**Why This is Critical**: Requirements should address **real stakeholder goals**, not invented needs. Understanding who cares about the project and why ensures:
- Requirements trace to stakeholder drivers
- Prioritization based on stakeholder power/interest
- Conflicts identified early
- Strong stakeholder buy-in

**Examples**:
```bash
/arckit.stakeholders Analyze stakeholders for payment gateway where CFO wants cost savings and CTO wants innovation
/arckit.stakeholders Map drivers to goals for customer portal project
/arckit.stakeholders Create stakeholder engagement plan for data warehouse migration
```

### Step 3: Run the Requirements Command

```bash
/arckit.requirements Create requirements for [your project]
```

The requirements command will:
- Check for stakeholder analysis (recommends creating it if missing)
- Trace requirements back to stakeholder goals
- Identify conflicts based on stakeholder conflicts
- Document resolution strategies

**Examples**:
```bash
/arckit.requirements Create requirements for payment gateway modernization
/arckit.requirements Define requirements for customer portal with self-service capabilities
/arckit.requirements Build requirements for data warehouse migration to cloud
```

### Step 4: Review and Refine

The command generates a comprehensive requirements document in `projects/NNN-project-name/requirements.md`. Review, refine, and validate with stakeholders.

**Purpose**: Define external system integrations

```markdown
### INT-001: Payment Gateway Integration

**Requirement**: Integrate with Stripe for payment processing.

**Integration Type**: RESTful API (HTTPS)

**Data Flow**:
1. Customer submits payment → Frontend
2. Frontend → Backend API (tokenized payment)
3. Backend → Stripe API (process payment)
4. Stripe → Webhook (payment confirmation)
5. Backend → Database (update order status)
6. Backend → Customer (confirmation email)

**API Endpoints Used**:
- POST /v1/payment_intents (create payment)
- POST /v1/payment_intents/{id}/confirm (confirm payment)
- POST /v1/refunds (process refund)

**Authentication**: Stripe API keys (secret key in Secrets Manager)

**Error Handling**:
- Network timeout (30s) → Retry 3x with exponential backoff
- Rate limit (429) → Backoff and retry
- Payment declined → Return error to customer

**Data Mapping**:
| Our System | Stripe API |
|------------|------------|
| order_id | metadata.order_id |
| customer_email | receipt_email |
| amount_cents | amount (integer, cents) |
| currency | currency (ISO 4217) |

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Successful payment processing
- [ ] Proper error handling for all failure modes

  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL  -- soft delete for GDPR
);

CREATE INDEX idx_customers_email ON customers(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_created_at ON customers(created_at);
```

**Data Classification**: PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

**Retention Policy**:
- Active customers: Indefinite

## Writing Effective Requirements

### Best Practices

#### 1. Be Specific and Measurable

❌ **Bad**: System should be fast
✅ **Good**: API endpoints MUST respond in < 2 seconds at P95

❌ **Bad**: System should be secure
✅ **Good**: System MUST implement OAuth 2.0 with MFA for admin access

#### 2. Use Clear Language

- **MUST** / **SHALL**: Mandatory requirement (failure = rejection)
- **SHOULD**: Strongly recommended (failure = points deducted in vendor eval)
- **MAY** / **COULD**: Optional nice-to-have

#### 3. Include Rationale

Always explain WHY:
```markdown
**Rationale**: Current system has 5-minute response times, causing customer
abandonment (40% drop-off rate). Industry standard is < 2 seconds.
```

#### 4. Define Acceptance Criteria

Make it testable:
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Unit test coverage > 80%
- [ ] All API endpoints have integration tests
- [ ] Load test demonstrates 10K TPS capability
- [ ] Security scan shows no high/critical vulnerabilities
```

#### 5. Identify Dependencies

```markdown
**Dependencies**:
- Requires INT-001 (Stripe integration)
- Blocks FR-015 (Subscription billing)
- Aligns with SEC-002 (API Security) principle
```

### Common Pitfalls

#### 1. Vague Requirements

❌ "System should handle lots of users"
✅ "System MUST support 10,000 concurrent users with < 2s response time"

#### 2. Solution Instead of Requirement

❌ "Use PostgreSQL database"
✅ "Require ACID-compliant database with < 100ms query response time"

(Let vendors propose PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

#### 3. Untestable Requirements

❌ "System should be user-friendly"
✅ "New users SHALL complete checkout in < 3 minutes with < 10% abandonment rate"

#### 4. Missing Non-Functionals

Don't forget:
- Performance (response time, throughput)
- Security (authentication, encryption, compliance)
- Reliability (uptime, MTBF, MTTR)
- Scalability (growth projections)
- Compliance (regulations, standards)

## Requirements Workflow

### 1. Gather Requirements

**Stakeholder Interviews**:
- Business stakeholders (objectives, ROI)
- End users (usability, workflows)
- Operations (reliability, monitoring)
- Security (compliance, threats)
- Legal (regulations, contracts)

**Techniques**:
- User story mapping
- Process flow diagrams
- Current state / future state analysis
- Competitive analysis

### 2. Write Requirements

```bash
/arckit.requirements Create requirements for [project]
```

ArcKit generates a comprehensive template. Fill in details from stakeholder interviews.

### 3. Review with Stakeholders

- **Business**: Validate business requirements and ROI
- **Technical**: Validate NFRs are achievable
- **Security**: Validate compliance requirements
- **Legal**: Validate regulatory requirements

### 4. Prioritize

Mark each requirement:
- **MUST**: Non-negotiable (vendor must comply or be disqualified)
- **SHOULD**: Important but negotiable
- **MAY**: Nice-to-have

### 5. Generate SOW/RFP

```bash
/arckit.sow Generate SOW for [project]
```

Requirements automatically flow into the RFP document.

### 6. Design Reviews

Use requirements as the checklist for HLD/DLD reviews:

```bash
/arckit.hld-review Review [vendor] HLD for [project]
```

Verify every requirement is addressed in the design.

### 7. Traceability

```bash
/arckit.traceability Generate matrix for [project]
```

Ensure every requirement is traced to design, implementation, and tests.
