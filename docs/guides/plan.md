# Project Plan Guide

A comprehensive guide to creating project plans with timelines, gates, and Mermaid diagrams using ArcKit.

---

## What is a Project Plan?

A project plan is a **visual timeline** that shows how your project flows from start to finish:
- **Phases** - Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live (GDS Agile Delivery)
- **Activities** - What gets done in each phase
- **Gates** - Decision points with approval criteria
- **Dependencies** - What must happen before what
- **Timeline** - When things happen (Gantt chart)
- **Workflow** - How artifacts flow through gates

### Why Project Plans Matter

Without project plans:
- ❌ Stakeholders unclear on timeline and milestones
- ❌ ArcKit commands run in wrong order or at wrong time
- ❌ Gates missed or bypassed (design reviews, assessments)
- ❌ Dependencies not understood (HLD blocks DLD)
- ❌ Resource conflicts (team assigned to conflicting work)
- ❌ Budget spent without clear phase alignment
- ❌ No critical path visibility

With project plans:
- ✅ Clear timeline visible to all stakeholders
- ✅ ArcKit workflow integrated into phases
- ✅ Gates enforced with approval criteria
- ✅ Dependencies mapped and respected
- ✅ Resource planning aligned to phases
- ✅ Budget tracking by phase
- ✅ Critical path identified and managed

**Mandatory for:**
- UK Government projects (GDS Service Standard)
- Projects > 3 months duration
- Multi-phase delivery (Discovery → Alpha → Beta → Live)
- Vendor-delivered projects
- Projects requiring governance gate approvals

---

## When to Create Plans

```bash
/arckit.plan Create project plan for [your project]
```

**Create at these points:**
- **Project initiation** - Initial plan for Discovery phase
- **Discovery exit** - Detailed plan for Alpha/Beta/Live
- **Gate reviews** - Update plan based on decisions
- **Major changes** - Timeline, scope, or resource changes
- **Monthly** - Refresh plan with actual progress

**Run at key gates:**
- **Before Discovery** - Create initial plan
- **Discovery Assessment** - Update with Alpha/Beta timeline
- **Alpha Assessment** - Confirm Beta/Live plan
- **Beta Assessment** - Finalize Go-Live plan

## Common Gaps and How to Fix Them

### Gap 1: No Clear Gates
**Problem**: Work continues from Discovery to Live without approval gates
**Fix**: Define clear gates with approval criteria and decision authority

### Gap 2: ArcKit Commands in Wrong Order
**Problem**: Running `/arckit.hld-review` before requirements are complete
**Fix**: Follow plan sequence - requirements → HLD → HLD review

### Gap 3: Skipping Phases
**Problem**: Jumping from Discovery to Beta without Alpha
**Fix**: Respect GDS phases - each phase has specific purpose

### Gap 4: No Timeline Visibility
**Problem**: Stakeholders don't know when milestones happen
**Fix**: Create Gantt chart showing all phases, gates, and milestones

### Gap 5: Gates Without Criteria
**Problem**: "Gate review" with no defined approval criteria
**Fix**: Define specific, measurable criteria for each gate

### Gap 6: No Dependency Management
**Problem**: DLD starts before HLD is approved
**Fix**: Use Gantt dependencies - HLD approval blocks DLD start

### Gap 7: Unrealistic Timelines
**Problem**: 4 weeks for Beta phase with 6 months of work
**Fix**: Use historical data - typical Beta is 12-24 weeks

### Gap 8: No Vendor Time
**Problem**: Procurement timeline not included in Alpha
**Fix**: Add 6-8 weeks for vendor SOW, evaluation, selection

---

**Large Projects** (Major transformations, complex systems):
- Discovery: 8-12 weeks
- Alpha: 12-16 weeks
- Beta: 24-52 weeks
- **Total**: 12-24 months

**Factors Affecting Duration**:
- Complexity (integrations, data migration, compliance)
- Vendor involvement (procurement adds 6-8 weeks)
- Security requirements (PCI-DSS, GDPR adds 4-8 weeks)
- Organizational readiness (stakeholder alignment, approvals)
- Team experience (new tech stack adds 20-30%)
