4. **Collaborate** — guides highlight handoff points with other roles

## About the DDaT Framework

The [Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) Capability Framework](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/) defines roles and skills for UK Government digital professionals. ArcKit maps its architecture governance commands to these roles so teams know exactly which tools support their work.

> **Not a UK Government team?** The role descriptions are universal — Enterprise Architect, Solution Architect, Product Manager etc. exist in every organisation. Use the DDaT names as a guide, not a constraint.
