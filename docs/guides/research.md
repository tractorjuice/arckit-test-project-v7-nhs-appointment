A guide to researching technologies, services, and products to inform build vs buy decisions using ArcKit.

## What is Technology Research?

Technology research identifies available solutions (commercial products, SaaS platforms, open source) that can meet project requirements, enabling informed build vs buy decisions.

### Why Research Matters

Without systematic research:
- ❌ Build custom solutions when good products exist
- ❌ Choose wrong vendors
- ❌ Miss cost-effective alternatives
- ❌ Reinvent the wheel

With comprehensive research:
- ✅ Informed build vs buy decisions
- ✅ Vendor shortlist with pros/cons
- ✅ TCO comparison across options
- ✅ Risk-aware selection
