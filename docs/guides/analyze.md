# Project Analysis Guide

A guide to running comprehensive quality analysis on projects using ArcKit.

---

## What is Project Analysis?

Project analysis provides a **health check** across all dimensions of project quality:
- Requirements coverage and completeness
- Risk management effectiveness
- Traceability integrity
- Compliance status
- Architecture quality
- Stakeholder alignment

### Why Run Analysis?

Without regular analysis:
- ‚ùå Hidden requirements gaps discovered late
- ‚ùå Unmitigated risks materialize
- ‚ùå Traceability breaks lead to audit failures
- ‚ùå Compliance issues discovered at gates
- ‚ùå Architecture drift goes unnoticed

With regular analysis:
- ‚úÖ Early detection of issues
- ‚úÖ Proactive risk mitigation
- ‚úÖ Continuous compliance
- ‚úÖ Audit-ready traceability
- ‚úÖ Quality visibility for stakeholders

---

## When to Analyze

```bash
/arckit.analyze Run comprehensive analysis for [your project]
```

**Run analysis at these key points:**
- **Weekly** - During active development
- **Before gates** - Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live assessments
- **Before reviews** - HLD/DLD reviews, design reviews
- **After major changes** - Architecture changes, new requirements
- **On demand** - When stakeholders request quality report

---

## What Gets Analyzed

### 1. Requirements Coverage

Analyzes completeness and quality of requirements:

**Checks:**
- All requirement types present (BR, FR, NFR, INT, DR)
- Requirements properly formatted with unique IDs
- MoSCoW prioritization assigned
- Acceptance criteria defined
- Stakeholder mapping complete
- No duplicate or conflicting requirements

**Output:**
```markdown
### Requirements Coverage: 85/100

**Strengths**:
- 45 functional requirements well-defined
- All requirements have acceptance criteria
- MoSCoW prioritization complete

**Gaps**:
- ‚ùå Missing NFR-A-001 to NFR-A-005 (accessibility requirements)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only 3 data requirements (expect 8-12 for e-commerce)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No integration requirements for payment gateway

**Recommendations**:
1. Add WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility requirements (UK Gov mandatory)
2. Document GDPR data requirements (retention, consent, erasure)
3. Define Stripe integration requirements (API contracts)
```

### 2. Risk Assessment

Analyzes risk register completeness and mitigation:

**Checks:**
- All risk categories covered (Technical, Business, External, People, Compliance, Security)
- Risk assessment methodology used (5√ó5 matrix)
- High risks have mitigation plans
- Risk owners assigned
- Residual risk within appetite
- Review dates tracked

**Output:**
```markdown
### Risk Assessment: 72/100

**Risk Register**: 15 risks identified

**Risk Distribution**:
- HIGH: 3 risks (2 mitigated, 1 open ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- MEDIUM: 8 risks (6 mitigated, 2 tolerated)
- LOW: 4 risks (tolerated)

**Critical Findings**:
- ‚ùå RISK-007 (HIGH) - No mitigation plan for vendor lock-in
- ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK-003 (MEDIUM) - GDPR compliance risk owner TBD
- ‚úÖ All technical risks have mitigations

**Recommendations**:
1. Create mitigation plan for RISK-007 (vendor lock-in)
   - Consider multi-cloud or abstraction layer
   - Document exit strategy
2. Assign GDPR compliance risk to Data Protection Officer
