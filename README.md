## Wardley Mapping for Strategic Architecture

**ArcKit integrates Wardley Mapping for strategic situational awareness and build vs buy decision-making.**

### What is Wardley Mapping?

Wardley Mapping is a strategic visualization technique that helps you:
- **Map the value chain**: From user needs → capabilities → components
- **Position by evolution**: Genesis (novel) → Custom → Product → Commodity
- **Identify movement**: How components evolve over time
- **Make strategic decisions**: Build vs Buy, vendor selection, technology choices

### Evolution Stages

| Stage | Evolution | Strategic Action | Example |
|-------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **Genesis** | 0.00-0.25 | Build only if strategic differentiator, R&D focus | Novel AI algorithm, new protocol |
| **Custom** | 0.25-0.50 | Critical build vs buy decision, invest in IP | Custom integration, specialized service |
| **Product** | 0.50-0.75 | Buy from vendors, compare features | Salesforce, Oracle, SAP |
| **Commodity** | 0.75-1.00 | Always use commodity/cloud, never build | AWS S3, Auth0, PostgreSQL |

### Wardley Mapping in ArcKit

The `/arckit.wardley` command creates strategic maps for:

**Current State Mapping**:
- Understand existing system landscape
- Identify technical debt and inertia
- Baseline for transformation

**Future State Mapping**:
- Visualize target architecture
- Plan evolution paths
- Strategic roadmap development

**Gap Analysis**:
- Compare current vs future state
- Prioritize investments
- Identify migration paths

**Vendor Comparison**:
- Compare vendor proposals strategically
- Assess vendor lock-in risks
- Validate vendor evolution positioning

**Procurement Strategy** (UK Government):
- Map components to Digital Marketplace frameworks
- Identify GOV.UK service reuse opportunities
- Align with Technology Code of Practice

### Example: Benefits Eligibility Chatbot (UK Government)

```bash
# Create Wardley Map for procurement strategy
/arckit.wardley Create procurement strategy Wardley Map for DWP benefits eligibility chatbot

# Map output shows:
# - BUILD: Benefits rules engine (Custom, 0.42) - domain expertise
# - BUILD: Human review queue (Custom, 0.45) - HIGH-RISK AI requirement
# - BUY (G-Cloud): GPT-4 (Product, 0.72) - commercial LLM
# - BUY (G-Cloud): Cloud hosting (Commodity, 0.95) - AWS via G-Cloud
# - REUSE: GOV.UK Notify (Commodity, 0.92) - email/SMS notifications
# - REUSE: GOV.UK Design System (Product, 0.75) - accessibility compliance
```

**Strategic Insights**:
- 40% build (competitive advantage components)
- 35% buy via G-Cloud (commodity/product components)
- 25% reuse GOV.UK services (avoid duplication)

### Wardley Mapping Integration

Wardley Maps integrate throughout the ArcKit workflow:

- **Requirements Phase**: Identify components and evolution stages
- **Procurement Phase**: Guide build vs buy decisions
- **Vendor Evaluation**: Compare vendor architectures strategically
- **Design Review**: Validate designs against strategic positioning
- **Analysis**: Detect misaligned decisions (building commodity components)

### Visualization

All Wardley Maps use the **OnlineWardleyMaps** format and can be visualized at:

**[https://create.wardleymaps.ai](https://create.wardleymaps.ai)**

Simply paste the map code from the generated document to see the visual map.

## Architecture Diagrams with Mermaid

**ArcKit generates visual architecture diagrams using Mermaid for clear technical communication.**

### What are Architecture Diagrams?

Architecture diagrams visualize system structure, interactions, and deployment for:
- **Technical Communication**: Share architecture with stakeholders
- **Design Documentation**: Document current and future state
- **Vendor Evaluation**: Compare vendor technical approaches
- **UK Government Compliance**: Visualize Cloud First, GOV.UK services, PII handling

### Diagram Types

ArcKit supports 6 essential diagram types based on the C4 Model and enterprise architecture best practices:

| Diagram Type | Level | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **C4 Context** | Level 1 | System in context with users and external systems | After requirements, to show system boundaries |
| **C4 Container** | Level 2 | Technical containers and technology choices | After HLD, for vendor review |
| **C4 Component** | Level 3 | Internal components within a container | After DLD, for implementation |
| **Deployment** | Infrastructure | Cloud resources and network topology | Cloud First compliance, cost estimation |
| **Sequence** | Interaction | API flows and request/response patterns | Integration requirements, API design |
| **Data Flow** | Data | How data moves, PII handling, GDPR compliance | UK GDPR, DPIA requirements |

### Using /arckit.diagram

The `/arckit.diagram` command generates diagrams automatically from your architecture artifacts:

```bash
# Auto-detect diagram type from context
/arckit.diagram Generate architecture diagram for payment gateway

# Explicit diagram type
/arckit.diagram context Generate C4 context diagram for benefits chatbot
/arckit.diagram container Generate C4 container diagram showing AWS services
/arckit.diagram component Generate component diagram for payment orchestrator
/arckit.diagram deployment Generate deployment diagram for production environment
/arckit.diagram sequence Generate sequence diagram for payment authorization flow
/arckit.diagram dataflow Generate data flow diagram showing PII handling for UK GDPR
```

### Strategic Integration with Wardley Maps

Diagrams integrate with Wardley Maps to show strategic positioning:

```mermaid
C4Container
    title Container Diagram - Payment Gateway

    Person(customer, "Customer", "User")

    System_Boundary(pg, "Payment Gateway") {
        Container(web, "Web Application", "React, TypeScript", "User interface, WCAG 2.2 AA")
        Container(api, "Payment API", "Node.js, Express", "RESTful API, 10K TPS")
        Container(orchestrator, "Payment Orchestrator", "Python", "Multi-provider routing [Custom 0.42]")
        ContainerDb(db, "Database", "PostgreSQL RDS", "Transaction data [Commodity 0.95]")
    }

    System_Ext(stripe, "Stripe", "Payment processor [Product 0.72]")
    System_Ext(paypal, "PayPal", "Payment processor [Product 0.72]")

    Rel(customer, web, "Uses", "HTTPS")
    Rel(web, api, "Calls", "REST/JSON")
    Rel(api, orchestrator, "Routes to", "")
    Rel(orchestrator, db, "Stores", "SQL")
    Rel(orchestrator, stripe, "Processes via", "REST API")
    Rel(orchestrator, paypal, "Processes via", "REST API")
```

**Note**: Components are annotated with evolution stages from Wardley Map:
- `[Custom 0.42]` = Build (competitive advantage)
- `[Product 0.72]` = Buy from vendor
- `[Commodity 0.95]` = Use cloud/utility service

### UK Government Compliance in Diagrams

Diagrams automatically include UK Government compliance elements:

**GOV.UK Services**:
```mermaid
C4Container
    System_Ext(notify, "GOV.UK Notify", "Messaging [REUSE]")
    System_Ext(pay, "GOV.UK Pay", "Payments [REUSE]")
    System_Ext(design, "GOV.UK Design System", "Frontend [REUSE]")
```

**Cloud First (TCoP Point 5)**:
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph AWS["AWS Cloud (G-Cloud)"]
        subgraph VPC["VPC 10.0.0.0/16"]
            ALB[Application Load Balancer]
            EC2[EC2 Auto Scaling Group]
            RDS[(RDS PostgreSQL)]
        end
    end

### Diagram Integration Throughout Workflow

Architecture diagrams integrate with the full ArcKit workflow:

- **Requirements Phase**: Generate context diagrams to visualize system boundaries
- **Procurement Phase**: Create deployment diagrams for cost estimation
- **Vendor Evaluation**: Compare vendor container diagrams side-by-side
- **HLD Review**: Validate container diagrams against architecture principles
- **DLD Review**: Review component diagrams and sequence diagrams
- **Traceability**: Link components to requirements in traceability matrix

### Component Inventory

All diagrams include a component inventory table with:

| Component | Type | Technology | Responsibility | Evolution Stage | Build/Buy |
|-----------|------|------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Payment Orchestrator | Service | Python | Multi-provider routing | Custom 0.42 | BUILD |
| Database | Data Store | PostgreSQL RDS | Transaction persistence | Commodity 0.95 | USE |
| Stripe Integration | External API | REST | Credit card processing | Product 0.72 | BUY |

**Evolution Stage Legend**:
- **Genesis (0.0-0.25)**: Novel, unproven, rapidly changing → BUILD only if strategic differentiator
- **Custom (0.25-0.50)**: Bespoke, emerging practices → Critical BUILD vs BUY decision
- **Product (0.50-0.75)**: Commercial products with features → BUY from vendors
- **Commodity (0.75-1.0)**: Utility services, standardized → USE cloud/commodity services

### Visualization

All diagrams use **Mermaid syntax** and can be visualized:

**GitHub**: Renders automatically in markdown preview

## ServiceNow Service Management Design

**ArcKit bridges the gap between architecture design and operational implementation with ServiceNow service management design.**

### The Architecture-to-Operations Gap

Most enterprise architecture tools stop at design documentation. ArcKit goes further by generating actionable ServiceNow configuration specifications that operations teams can implement directly.

### What is ServiceNow Design?

ServiceNow is the leading enterprise service management platform (ITSM, CMDB, Change Management). The `/arckit.servicenow` command automatically generates comprehensive service designs from your architecture artifacts.

### Key Features

**CMDB Design (Configuration Management Database)**:
- Automatically generates CMDB structure from architecture diagrams
- CI hierarchy maps 1:1 with C4 container diagrams
- Component attributes (technology stack, cloud resources, health checks)
- CI relationships (hosted on, depends on, connected to)

**SLA Definitions (Service Level Agreements)**:
- Availability SLA derived from NFR-Availability requirements
- Performance SLA derived from NFR-Performance requirements
- Incident resolution SLA based on service tier (Tier 1/2/3)
- Support coverage hours (24/7 vs business hours)

**Incident Management Design**:
- Priority matrix (P1-P5) aligned with service criticality
- Incident categories mapped to architecture components
- Assignment groups for each component
- Complete P1 incident response runbook
- Escalation paths and on-call rotation

**Change Management Plan**:
- Change categories (Standard/Normal/Emergency/Major)
- Risk assessment matrix
- Maintenance windows and blackout periods
- Rollback plans and decision criteria

**Monitoring & Alerting**:
- Health check endpoints from sequence diagrams
- Technical metrics (CPU, memory, error rate, response time)
- Alert routing rules (PagerDuty, Slack, ServiceNow)
- Operational and business dashboards

**Service Transition Plan**:
- Go-live readiness checklist (40+ items)
- Cutover plan with timeline and rollback triggers
- Training plan for support teams
- Post-go-live review schedule

### Using /arckit.servicenow

Generate ServiceNow design after completing architecture:

```bash
# After creating requirements and architecture diagrams
/arckit.servicenow Generate ServiceNow design for payment gateway - Tier 1 critical service with 24/7 support

# Output includes:
# - Service Overview (owner, dependencies)
# - Service Catalog entry design
# - CMDB structure (6 CIs for payment gateway)
# - Change Management plan
# - Incident Management design (P1 response: 15 min)
# - SLA definitions (99.95% availability, <500ms p95)
# - Monitoring & alerting plan
# - Knowledge base article plan
# - Service transition checklist
# - Requirements traceability
```

### Architecture Integration

ServiceNow design is derived from existing architecture artifacts:

**From Requirements** → SLAs:
- NFR-Availability: 99.9% → Service Tier 2 → 99.9% SLA
- NFR-Performance: <500ms → <500ms p95 response time SLA
- NFR-Security: PCI-DSS → Strict change control, ECAB for emergency changes
- NFR-Capacity: 10K concurrent users → Throughput SLA

**From Architecture Diagrams** → CMDB:
- C4 Context diagram → Top-level Service CI + external dependencies
- C4 Container diagram → Application CIs (web app, API, database)
- Deployment diagram → Infrastructure CIs (EC2, RDS, Lambda)
- Data flow diagram → CMDB relationships (which components depend on which)
- Sequence diagram → Health check endpoints for monitoring

**From Wardley Map** → Change Risk:
- Genesis/Custom components → High risk changes (CAB required)
- Product components → Medium risk (CAB for major changes)
- Commodity components → Low risk (standard changes possible)

### Example: Payment Gateway

**Input** (from architecture artifacts):
- Requirements: 99.9% availability, <500ms response time, PCI-DSS
- Container diagram: Web App, Payment API, Orchestrator, PostgreSQL, Stripe/PayPal
- Wardley Map: Orchestrator is Custom (0.42), Stripe is Product (0.72), PostgreSQL is Commodity (0.95)

**Output** (ServiceNow design):
```markdown
**Service**: Payment Gateway
**Service Tier**: Tier 2 (Important)
**Availability SLA**: 99.9% (43.8 min downtime/month)
**Performance SLA**: <500ms p95 response time
**Support**: 24/7 on-call (financial service)

**CMDB Structure**:
├── Payment Gateway (Service CI)
    ├── Payment Web App (Application CI) - Product 0.72
    ├── Payment API (Application CI) - Product 0.72
    ├── Payment Orchestrator (Application CI) - Custom 0.42 [BUILD]
    ├── PostgreSQL RDS (Database CI) - Commodity 0.95 [USE]
    ├── Stripe Integration (External CI) - Product 0.72 [BUY]
    └── PayPal Integration (External CI) - Product 0.72 [BUY]

**Incident Management**:
- P1 (Critical): 1 hour response, 8 hours resolution
- P2 (High): 4 hours response, 24 hours resolution
- Categories: Auth, API, Database, Frontend, Infrastructure
- Assignment Groups: PaymentGateway-Backend-L2, DBA-Support, etc.

**Change Management**:
- Payment Orchestrator: CAB required (Custom component, high business value)
- Database schema changes: CAB + ECAB option (data risk)
- Stripe/PayPal config: Standard change (vendor-managed)
- Maintenance window: Sunday 02:00-06:00 UTC
- Blackout periods: Black Friday week, year-end (peak transaction volume)
```

### ITIL v4 Alignment

ServiceNow designs follow ITIL v4 best practices:

**Service Value Chain Activities**:
- **Plan**: Change Management (CAB, risk assessment)
- **Improve**: Post-incident reviews, quarterly runbook reviews
- **Engage**: Service Catalog, user training
- **Design & Transition**: CMDB design, go-live checklist
- **Obtain/Build**: Change management for releases
- **Deliver & Support**: Incident Management, SLA monitoring

**Continual Improvement**:
- Post-incident reviews within 48 hours of major incidents
- Runbook reviews quarterly
- SLA performance reviews monthly
- Service design reviews after architectural changes

### UK Government Integration

For UK Government projects, ServiceNow design includes:

**GDS Service Standard Compliance** (Point 13):
- Service Standard assessment criteria
- Performance metrics aligned with KPIs
- Accessibility monitoring (WCAG 2.2 AA)

**Technology Code of Practice** (from TCoP assessment):

- Data (Point 10): Data retention, UK GDPR compliance

**GOV.UK Services**:
- CMDB CIs for GOV.UK Notify, Pay, Design System (REUSE)
- Service dependencies mapped
- SLAs aligned with GOV.UK service availability

### Example: DWP Benefits Chatbot (UK Government)

```bash
/arckit.servicenow Generate ServiceNow design for DWP Benefits Eligibility Chatbot - Tier 1 HIGH-RISK AI service

# Output includes:
# - Service Tier: Tier 1 (99.95% SLA) - critical service for benefits access
# - CMDB: 8 CIs (Web, API, GPT-4, Rules Engine, Human Review Queue, DB, GOV.UK Notify, DWP Legacy)
# - Incident Management: P1 response 15 min (citizens blocked from benefits)
# - Change Management: HIGH-RISK AI → ECAB + senior leadership approval for changes
# - Compliance: DPIA completed, ATRS published, AI Playbook compliance
# - Monitoring: Bias metrics, human-in-loop SLA (100% of advice reviewed before citizen sees it)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Token Limit Error

If you see: `API Error: Claude's response exceeded the 32000 output token maximum`

**The Problem**: ArcKit generates large documents that can exceed Claude's 32K token output limit.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Your Claude subscription plan determines the maximum tokens:
- 🔴 Free/Pro plans: **32K max** (cannot be increased)
- ✅ Team/Enterprise plans: Can increase to 64K via environment variable

**Solutions**:

1. **For Team/Enterprise plans** - Increase token limit:
   ```bash
   export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=64000
   ```

2. **For ALL plans** (including Free/Pro) - Use **Write tool strategy**:
   ```
   User: /arckit.requirements but write directly to file using Write tool, show me only a summary
   ```

   This tells Claude to use the Write tool to create the file (doesn't count toward output tokens) and only show you a summary.

**Which commands are affected?**
- 🔴 HIGH RISK: `/arckit.research`, `/arckit.sobc`, `/arckit.requirements`, `/arckit.data-model`, `/arckit.sow`
- 🟡 MEDIUM RISK: `/arckit.risk`, `/arckit.evaluation`, `/arckit.principles`

**See full guide**: [docs/TOKEN-LIMITS.md](docs/TOKEN-LIMITS.md)

### Common Issues

**Command not found**: Ensure Claude Code is installed and commands are loaded
```bash
# Check if .claude/commands/ directory exists
ls .claude/commands/
```

**Template not found**: Ensure you've run `/arckit.principles` first
```bash
# Check if templates exist
ls templates/
```

**Project creation fails**: Ensure you have an ArcKit repository initialized
```bash
# Initialize if needed
arckit init .
```
