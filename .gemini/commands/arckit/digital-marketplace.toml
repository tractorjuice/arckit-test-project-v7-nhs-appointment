description = ""⚠️ DEPRECATED: Use /arckit.dos or /arckit.gcloud-search instead""
prompt = """
# ⚠️ THIS COMMAND IS DEPRECATED

**This command has been split into two focused commands for better user experience:**

## Use These Commands Instead:

### For Custom Software Development (95% of cases)
**`/arckit.dos`** - Digital Outcomes and Specialists

Use this when you need:
- Custom software development
- Developers, architects, designers, specialists
- Project outcomes requiring custom implementation

Benefits:
- ✅ Focused on DOS only (no confusion)
- ✅ Simpler, cleaner output (~400 lines)
- ✅ Faster generation (no branching logic)
- ✅ Covers most arc-kit use cases

### For Off-the-Shelf Cloud Services (5% of cases)
**`/arckit.gcloud-search`** - G-Cloud with Live Marketplace Search

Use this when you need:
- Cloud hosting, IaaS, PaaS
- SaaS platforms and tools
- No custom development

Benefits:
- ✅ **Live Digital Marketplace search** (finds actual services)
- ✅ Service comparison with suppliers, prices, features
- ✅ Recommendations based on requirements
- ✅ Direct links to service pages

---

## Why the Split?

The original command tried to do too much:
- Complex branching logic (DOS vs G-Cloud decision)
- 754 lines (hard to maintain)
- Didn't leverage WebSearch (only generated requirements, not actual services)

The new commands are:
- **Simpler**: Clear purpose, no confusion
- **More Powerful**: G-Cloud search finds real services
- **Easier to Maintain**: Smaller, focused templates
- **Better UX**: Users know which command to use

---

## Migration Guide

**Old command:**
```
/arckit.digital-marketplace Generate DOS procurement
```

**New commands:**
```
/arckit.dos Generate DOS procurement requirements
/arckit.gcloud-search Find G-Cloud monitoring services
```

---

## Legacy Support

This command still works but is no longer recommended. It will be removed in a future version.

**Please update your workflows to use the new commands.**

---

# Original Command (Legacy - For Reference Only)

You are helping an enterprise architect prepare procurement documentation for the UK Digital Marketplace.

## User Input

```text
{{args}}
```

## Context

The UK Digital Marketplace is the official UK government procurement platform with two main frameworks:
- **DOS (Digital Outcomes and Specialists)**: For custom development, specialists, or project outcomes
- **G-Cloud**: For off-the-shelf cloud services, hosting, SaaS platforms

This command generates Digital Marketplace-compliant documentation from your existing ArcKit project.

## Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites Check

**IMPORTANT**: Check prerequisites before proceeding:

a. **Architecture Principles** (MUST exist):
   - Check if `.arckit/templates/architecture-principles.md` exists
   - If NOT found: ERROR \"Run /arckit.principles first to define governance standards\"

b. **Project with Requirements** (MUST exist):
   - Check if user specified a project name/number
   - Look for `projects/[project]/requirements.md`
   - If NOT found: ERROR \"Run /arckit.requirements first to define project needs\"

c. **Stakeholder Analysis** (RECOMMENDED):
   - Check if `projects/[project]/stakeholder-drivers.md` exists
   - If NOT found: WARN \"Consider running /arckit.stakeholders to understand stakeholder priorities\"
   - If exists: Read it to inform procurement priorities

d. **Existing SOW** (OPTIONAL):
   - Check if `projects/[project]/procurement/sow.md` exists
   - If exists: Reference it for additional context
   - This command generates Digital Marketplace-specific docs alongside general SOW

### 2. Load Project Context

Run `.arckit/scripts/bash/list-projects.sh --json` to get available projects, then:

1. Read `projects/[project]/requirements.md` (source of truth)
2. Read `.arckit/templates/architecture-principles.md` (governance constraints)
3. Read `projects/[project]/stakeholder-drivers.md` if available (priorities)
4. Parse user input for additional context (budget, timeline, specific skills)

### 3. Framework Selection (DOS vs G-Cloud)

Analyze the requirements to determine which Digital Marketplace framework applies:

**DOS (Digital Outcomes and Specialists)** - Use when:
- Custom software development is needed
- Requirements specify building/implementing new systems
- Need developers, architects, designers, or technical specialists
- Need a team to deliver a specific project outcome
- Functional requirements (FR-xxx) describe features to be built
- **DEFAULT for most ArcKit projects**

**G-Cloud** - Use when:
- Buying off-the-shelf cloud services or software
- Requirements specify hosting, cloud platforms, monitoring tools
- Integration requirements (INT-xxx) mention SaaS/PaaS/IaaS
- No custom development - just service procurement
- **RARE** - only when explicitly buying infrastructure/tools

**Decision Logic**:
1. Scan requirements for keywords:
   - DOS indicators: \"develop\", \"build\", \"implement\", \"create\", \"design\", \"custom\"
   - G-Cloud indicators: \"cloud hosting\", \"SaaS\", \"IaaS\", \"PaaS\", \"monitoring service\", \"platform\"
2. If ambiguous, ASK user: \"Is this for custom development (DOS) or buying cloud services (G-Cloud)?\"
3. **Default to DOS** if requirements include any FR-xxx (functional requirements)

### 4. Generate Procurement Documentation

Create directory: `projects/[project]/procurement/`

#### For DOS (Digital Outcomes and Specialists)

Generate `projects/[project]/procurement/digital-marketplace-dos.md`:

```markdown
# UK Digital Marketplace Procurement: [PROJECT_NAME]

**Framework**: Digital Outcomes and Specialists (DOS)
**Procurement Type**: [Digital Outcome / Digital Specialists]

### 6. Report Completion

Output to user:

```
✅ Generated Digital Marketplace procurement documentation for [PROJECT_NAME]

Framework: [DOS / G-Cloud]
Document: projects/[project]/procurement/digital-marketplace-[dos|gcloud].md

Integration Summary:
- ✅ Requirements extracted from requirements.md
- ✅ Architecture principles enforced
- [✅/⚠️] Stakeholder priorities included (stakeholder-drivers.md)
- [✅/⚠️] Cross-referenced with existing SOW (sow.md)

Next Steps:
1. Review generated documentation with procurement and stakeholder teams
2. Add budget details if not already specified
3. Obtain formal approval for procurement
4. Publish on Digital Marketplace: https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/
5. Follow Digital Marketplace process: [link to appropriate guide]

Related ArcKit Commands:
- /arckit.evaluate - Create vendor evaluation framework after receiving proposals
- /arckit.dld-review - Set up design review process for vendor deliverables
- /arckit.traceability - Validate requirements traceability with vendor

Important: Maintain audit trail of all procurement decisions per Digital Marketplace requirements.
```

## Key Principles

1. **Requirements First**: Always pull from requirements.md - don't invent new requirements
2. **Principle Enforcement**: Ensure architecture principles constrain vendor proposals
3. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Reflect stakeholder priorities in evaluation criteria
4. **Technology-Agnostic**: Remove all implementation details from procurement docs
5. **Traceability**: Maintain requirement IDs (BR-xxx, FR-xxx, etc.) throughout
6. **Audit-Ready**: Structure supports Digital Marketplace audit requirements
7. **Gov.uk Aligned**: Use official terminology and link to authoritative guidance
8. **Integration**: Complement existing /arckit.sow - don't duplicate, specialize for Digital Marketplace

## Framework Decision Examples

**DOS Examples** (Most ArcKit Projects):
- \"Payment gateway modernization\" (custom development)
- \"Service management platform integration\" (custom implementation)
- \"Data warehouse for analytics\" (custom data solution)
- \"API gateway and microservices\" (custom architecture)

**G-Cloud Examples** (Rare):
- \"Cloud hosting for applications\" (infrastructure)
- \"Monitoring and observability platform\" (SaaS tool)
- \"Email delivery service\" (SaaS tool)
- \"CI/CD pipeline platform\" (SaaS tool)

## Error Handling

- **No principles**: ERROR \"Run /arckit.principles first - governance standards required\"
- **No requirements**: ERROR \"Run /arckit.requirements first - nothing to procure\"
- **Ambiguous framework**: ASK \"Is this for custom development (DOS) or buying cloud services (G-Cloud)?\"
- **No project**: Suggest project creation with `.arckit/scripts/bash/create-project.sh`
